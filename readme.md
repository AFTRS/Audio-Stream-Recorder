## Audio Stream Recorder

This project was started out of a desire to record internet audio streams in one hour blocks.

There are many tutorials online on how to record audio streams, however they usually involve setting up physical or virtual audio channels and then using software like audacity to record the stream as 'audio'.

This projects approach is to 'record' the stream data directly as .WAV and then convert it to .MP3 for playback.
